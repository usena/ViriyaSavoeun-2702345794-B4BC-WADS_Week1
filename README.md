Microservice Architecture

Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of two or more services that are:

    Independently deployable

    Loosely coupled

Services are typically organized around business capabilities. Each service is often owned by a single, small team.

Microservices enable fast flow

For a business to thrive in todayâ€™s volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, IT must deliver that software rapidly, frequently and reliably.

To do that for large complex applications you need the success triangle.

Design microservices using Assemblage

The key challenge when using microservices is designing a good service architecture. If you get it wrong you risk creating a distributed monolith, which will slow down software delivery. Assemblage is an architecture definition process for grouping subdomains/bounded contexts into services.
